# StockMarket_C++

Coding a stock market based on c++, considering the system input as "a stack of strings" following a specific pattern.
it starts from run function.

there are insert command, pull command, and edit command.
the commands are like ["insert", "id", "price","volume","sell / buy", "'A'/'T'/'W'" as a brand]
for other commands, the format is obviously different.
